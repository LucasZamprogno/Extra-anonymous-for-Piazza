# Extra-anonymous-for-Piazza

This is a now outdated chrome extension to change Piazza's display of "FirstName LastName (anon. to classmates)" to "Anonymous #1" that shows names on mouseover to avoid instructors using students' names by accident. A new feature mostly does this, but someone said this was better for some reason so I need to update this to work with the new changes (and Firefox).
